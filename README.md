Dosage is a comic strip downloader and archiver.

Dosage is designed to keep a local copy of specific webcomics and other
picture-based content such as Picture of the Day sites.  With the dosage
commandline script you can get the latest strip of a webcomic, or catch-up to
the last strip downloaded, or download a strip for a particular date/index (if
the webcomic's site layout allows this).

Multiple webcomics can be downloaded in parallel, making the update of comic
strips faster.

See http://dosage.rocks/ for more info.
