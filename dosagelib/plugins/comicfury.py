Soon, they became friends, and Daisy allowed Burt to chronicle her daily life in exchange for baked chicken dinners, trips to the dog park, and custom made collars. Daisy loves children, tolerates adults, and absolutely hates rabbits. It\'s in her blood. Since the 1500\'s her breed has been raised to find rabbits. Unfortunately, Daisy has somehow twisted this tracking talent into a personal vendetta. She earnestly feels that rabbits are evil and must be hunted down and destroyed. As such, many in the rabbit community have taken exception to this attitude. Several restraining orders have been taken out against Daisy, but she simply chews them up the moment they\'re served. Each morning, she awakes with a smile on her face, a spring in her step, and a singular phrase in her mind, "Die Rabbit, Die!"')

add('Sonichuredone', 'http://sonichuredone.webcomic.ws/', u"Remember Sonichu? Well, start forgeting it, because Sonichu: RE-Done is here. An all new version of sonichu, made from obselete paint programs and cheap photoshops. Join Dash Sonichu and his friends as they journey through CWCville in adventures that involve beating up Jerkops, or trying to get rid of Chris. It's the first Sonichu comic made for multiple languages, so everyone can read the failtastic tales of Dash Sonichu. As of March 12, 2012, Chris-chan himself has, for some reason, declared this comic as an official Sonichu re-make. As of July 2012, Chris-chan has given the official Sonichu rights to Screws Enterprises, as he is soon to be shown in court on 10th July. As of December 20th 2012, Sonichu: RE-Done in English has been completed, and will no longer publish new adventures any time soon. Please check the blog for further updates...")
