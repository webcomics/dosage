Dosage v.0.3.0:
    * Removed filename override:
        Since the comic modules now generally have sane names, this is no
        longer of much use.
    * Better feedback:

        output.

        @ expands to every comic already present in the basepath, and @@
        expands to every single comic supported by Dosage.

        - AppleGeeks
        - ButternutSquash

            Switch back to the "low" resolution comics; some of the "high"
            resolution comics are broken, and the "low" ones seem to be
            identical anyway.
    * Junview:
        Lots of fixes / enhancements, still fairly alpha.

Dosage v.0.2.0:
    * Virtual comic modules

        comic modules.
    * Junview:
        Image viewer written in wxPython, pretty alpha at this stage,
        but feel free to play around with it if you're brave.

    * Various documentation updates
    * Added comics:
        - LittleGamers

        - PvPonline
        - RadioactivePanda
        - ScaryGoRound
    * Fixed comics:
        - PennyArcade
            The comic "bounces" when you get to the first strip, the
            "previous" link points to the second comic. Work around this by
            checking for the first comic.
        - SexyLosers
            SexyLosers seems to have implemented referrer checking recently,
            this is handled by the new referrer passing support.

        The documentation has better examples now.
